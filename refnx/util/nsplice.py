def get_scaling_in_overlap(x0, y0, dy0, x1, y1, dy1):
    r"""
    Obtain vertical scaling factor that splices the second dataset onto the
    first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x0: np.ndarray
        abscissae for the first dataset
    y0: np.ndarray
        y values for the first dataset
    dy0: np.ndarray
        dy (standard deviation) values for the first dataset
    x1: np.ndarray
        abscissae values for the second dataset
    y1: np.ndarray
        y values for the second dataset
    dy1: np.ndarray
        dy (standard deviation) values for the second dataset

    Returns
    -------
    (scale, dscale, overlap_points): float, float, array-like
        `scale` and `dscale` are the scaling and uncertainty in scaling factor.
        They are `np.nan` if the abscissae ranges don't overlap.
        `overlap_points` indicates the points in the *first* dataset that are
        in the overlap region.
